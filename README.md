# OpenDots - Secure Authentication System

This project demonstrates a secure authentication system using Next.js and Supabase. It includes features for Google OAuth authentication with enhanced security and user data collection.

## Security Features

- **Secure User Profiles**: User data is stored in a separate profiles table with row-level security
- **OAuth Integration**: Google authentication with proper scope handling
- **Device Information Tracking**: Captures platform, browser, and location information
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie handling with HTTP-only and secure flags
- **Security Headers**: Implements best practice security headers in middleware
- **Database Triggers**: Automatic profile creation on user signup
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation of user data
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security ensures users can only access their own data

## Setting Up Authentication

1. Configure your Supabase project with the necessary environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

2. Set up Google OAuth:
   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Create OAuth credentials
   - Add authorized redirect URIs: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`
   - Configure Supabase Auth settings with your Google client ID and secret

3. Run migrations to set up the database:
   - The migrations will create the profiles table
   - Set up triggers for automatic profile creation
   - Configure row-level security policies

## Database Schema

The profile schema includes:
- `id`: UUID (linked to auth.users)
- `email`: User's email
- `full_name`: User's full name
- `avatar_url`: URL to user's avatar
- `provider`: Authentication provider (e.g., 'google')
- `location`: User's location
- `platform`: Device platform (Desktop/Mobile)
- `browser`: Browser information
- `created_at`: Timestamp of profile creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" 
2. Client collects device information
3. Server initiates OAuth flow with Supabase
4. User authenticates with Google
5. Google redirects back with authentication code
6. Server exchanges code for session
7. Profile is created or updated with device information
8. User is redirected to protected page

## Best Practices

1. **Middleware Security**:
   - HTTP-only cookies
   - Secure flags in production
   - Security headers

2. **Database Security**:
   - Row-level security
   - Secure functions with SECURITY DEFINER
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **User Data Protection**:
   - Minimal data collection
   - Secure storage
   - Clear logout process

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run database migrations
npx supabase migration up
```

## Features

- Works across the entire [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) stack
  - App Router
  - Pages Router
  - Middleware
  - Client
  - Server
  - It just works!
- supabase-ssr. A package to configure Supabase Auth to use cookies
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Components with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Optional deployment with [Supabase Vercel Integration and Vercel deploy](#deploy-your-own)
  - Environment variables automatically assigned to Vercel project

## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.
